                   Knowledge of the market, and technology in terms of both hardware and software employed, provides the insurance companies with an efficient revenue cycle management process, transforming their operations and boosting an effective revenue growth. Inniti’s global presence in the Insurance sector has more than often demonstrated its commitment to implementing rigorous implementation of compliances to be met by the Insurance industry.

                      <%--<p class="center" style="margin:0px 0px -11px 0px !important">--%><p>
According to, Tom Barnard, Client Operations Director, “Inniti’s expertise in the seamless process right from the preliminary process of enrollment to its state of the art approach in implementing predictive analysis to unearthing fraudulent activities and determining futuristic trends, impacts the revenue growth and provides a comprehensive and complete solution to the Insurance sector”. </p>
                    <p>

                        Inniti’s customized and detailed approach helps clients achieve results faster and at lower cost, making it perfect for the Insurance sector to thus focus on building their present and future strategies.   </p>
   <p>Achieving compliance along with increased revenue growth for the Insurance services helps the insurance sector in lowering investing in hardware, recurring software upgrades and investing in regular staff trainings.  </p>
   <p>Business complexity related is said to be an important driver of operating costs and given the changing rules and regulations is often seen as limiting insurers’ abilities to leverage economies of scale.  This often results in higher costs in both operations and administrative areas. Back-office functions spread across geographies are often cited as a cause for drop in customer satisfaction due to not being able to consolidate or optimize the processes and workflows, which is known to be one of the major factors causing financial deterioration.	Tom also stated that, “complex legacy systems can lead to increased IT expenditure and lowered productivity due to new learning of the systems and processes. And all this adds to lowered performance management when one factors in other repercussions of mismanaged workflows and processes”.  </p>
