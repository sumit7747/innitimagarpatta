                                      <p>For Insurance companies, First Notice of Loss (FNOL) is one of the most important processes in the claims-management lifecycle. It is the highest value customer touch point and thus represents an opportunity to build customer loyalty. It is meant for client care and service at first point of contact.</p>
<p>The FNOL process involves accessing multiple legacy systems and the existing systems for content management and customer relationship management. Due to delays in updating information in all corresponding systems, accurate status is not readily available to everyone which impacts reporting.</p>
<p><strong>Challenges faced by Insurers in the FNOL process:</strong></p>
 <ul class="ulq">
<li>Delayed claim status reports or closure notification to agents and claimants.</li>
<li>Low productivity due to the long time it takes to register a claim as details from different systems need to be verified. The process comprises manual intervention which results in higher claim processing cost.</li>
<li>Reduced efficiency due to manual errors and disparate claim information across multiple systems.</li>
<li>Intense training required for customer service representatives to attain proficiency in claims processing leading to higher training cost and time.</li>
</ul>
