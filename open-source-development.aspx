<p>This competitive business environment creates unique challenges for insurance companies in terms of employee productivity, organizational responsiveness, regulatory pressures, talent management and cost control. Using standard open source development solutions insurers have responded very well to automated business processes. However, while this issue has been addressed by insurance IT solutions teams, the inherent need to capture the value-creating knowledge inputs has not been served well using the same platform.</p>

<li>Scale to capture increased demand for select products and support diversified geographic footprint</li>
<li>Expand distribution channels, while maintaining excellence in customer service</li>
<li>Removing paper and automating Claims Management support to reduce cost and settlement timeframes within the claims life cycle</li>
